I live in Montevideo, Uruguay, I've been working with Ruby since 2010; Sinatra, Rails, Rails Engines, Angular, Node, Ionic, and React, are my usual tools of choice; I'm an Agile enthusiast, I'm proactive and business minded. I like to work in projects aligned with my interests, and most of the time I can't help to speak my mind, even if sometimes its not what you want to hear.

Let me make your job easier:

## What do my colleagues say about me?

I’ve worked with Matis in several projects. He is a pragmatic developer, capable of adopting anything that proves useful and leaving behind anything that proves doesn’t.

## What do my bosses say about me?

I've had the pleasure of working with Matis for several years. Outside of being a programmer, he's an exceptional thinker. He has the capacity to be a leader, an architect, and an implementer. Give him a problem and he can solve it. Matis bears the qualities to be an exceptional asset to any team or project. He is a true business-minded engineer which is extremely hard to come by these days.

*Rossina Simonelli* _Co-founder at Crafted Code_
Matis is the perfect mix of a senior full stack developer and a client principal. He’s got exceptional communication skills and a strong CS background. He is always willing to help clients figuring out what they really need in order to achieve their business goals. I really enjoyed working with Matis, he is an excellent team player!

## What do clients say about me?

*Sam McAfee* _Business model innovator | Author of Startup Patterns_
Working with Matis was great! He's a smart and capable leader, able to cut through the complexity to the essence of a problem, while respecting the nuances of context. He is keenly focused on delivering value, and can apply a range of methodologies without getting bogged down in the dogma of any single approach. I'd highly recommend him for any digital product endeavor.

*Alex Moroch* _Founder and CEO at FEM Marketing_
We worked with Matis and the team at Crafted Code for a hybrid mobile application development project. From the beginning, the team was organized and accommodating to the time difference and set up a very efficient project management and tracking system for our executive team. Crafted is an agile and smart group of folks to work with for any application MVP project or development. We are looking forward to the continued partnership -
