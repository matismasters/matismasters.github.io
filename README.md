I live in Montevideo, Uruguay, I've been working with Ruby since 2010; Sinatra, Rails, Rails Engines, Angular, Node, Ionic, and React, are my usual tools of choice; I'm an Agile enthusiast, I'm proactive and business minded. I like to work in projects aligned with my interests, and most of the time I can't help to speak my mind, even if sometimes its not what you want to hear.
