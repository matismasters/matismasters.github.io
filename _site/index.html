He is a true business-minded engineer which is extremely hard to come by these days.</p>

<p>We worked with Matis and the team at Crafted Code for a hybrid mobile application development project. From the beginning, the team was organized and accommodating to the time difference and set up a very efficient project management and tracking system for our executive team. Crafted is an agile and smart group of folks to work with for any application MVP project or development. We are looking forward to the continued partnership -</p>
