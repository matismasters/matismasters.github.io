I've had the pleasure of working with Matis for several years. Outside of being a programmer, he's an exceptional thinker. He has the capacity to be a leader, an architect, and an implementer. Give him a problem and he can solve it. Matis bears the qualities to be an exceptional asset to any team or project. He is a true business-minded engineer which is extremely hard to come by these days.

Working with Matis was great! He's a smart and capable leader, able to cut through the complexity to the essence of a problem, while respecting the nuances of context. He is keenly focused on delivering value, and can apply a range of methodologies without getting bogged down in the dogma of any single approach.

We worked with Matis and the team at Crafted Code for a hybrid mobile application development project. From the beginning, the team was organized and accommodating to the time difference and set up a very efficient project management and tracking system for our executive team. Crafted is an agile and smart group of folks to work with for any application MVP project or development. We are looking forward to the continued partnership -
